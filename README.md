# Straight-Line-Equation (Version 1.1)

Uses two user input coordinates to produce a straight line equation. 

Assuming if the user has two coordinates. Let's just say point A has coordinates (4,1/3) and point B has coordinates (1/3, 2). 

The program will take those numbers, and seperate the integers from the fractional numbers and begin to calculate the slope (gradient - rate of increase) and the intercept. Then, after it will print out the correct straight line equation. 

PLEASE NOTE: this function will not work with natural logs such as e^x, or Ï€ and vice versa. Furthermore, the result will always produce in the form of 'y=mx+c' so other straight-line forms such as ax+by+c = 0 will not be possible.  However, future updates will solve these issues.
